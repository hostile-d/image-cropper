# image-cropper
Tool which get image URL, crops it to 1:1 aspect ratio and then upload it to the same server and provides URL of it.
Uses 'cover' setting for crop by default.
It was used to help my collegue manage client's facebook accout. Some sections of this network requires square images to upload, but those on the clien's website mostly had rectangle shape, so this tool helps her to save time and do routine for her.
